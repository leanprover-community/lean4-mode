Lean4-Mode - Emacs major mode for Lean language
***********************************************

This package extends GNU Emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) by
providing a major mode for editing code written in version 4 of the
programming language and theorem prover Lean (https://lean-lang.org).

   The Lean4-Mode source code is developed at Github
(https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode) and its issues
tracked there too.  Further discussions and question-answering takes
place in the #Emacs channel
(https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/468104-Emacs) of
Lean's Zulip chat.

   For legacy version 3 of Lean, use the archived Lean3-Mode
(https://github.com/leanprover/lean3-mode) (also known as _Lean-Mode_).

1.1 Brief and Generic Instructions
==================================

First, install the dependencies of Lean4-Mode:
   • Lean (https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html) (version 4)
   • Emacs (version 27 or later)
   • Emacs packages Dash (https://github.com/magnars/dash.el) (available
     on GNU-Elpa), lsp-mode (https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode), and
     Magit-Section
     (https://github.com/magit/magit/blob/main/lisp/magit-section.el)
     (available on Melpa)

   Second, install Lean4-Mode itself:
   • Clone the Git repository of Lean4-Mode
     (https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode).
   • In your Emacs initialization file
     (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html),
     add the path to that local repository to the ‘load-path’ list.


File: lean4-mode.info,  Node: Detailed and Concrete Instructions,  Next: Instructions for Source-Based Use-Package,  Prev: Brief and Generic Instructions,  Up: Installation

1.2 Detailed and Concrete Instructions
======================================

Install Lean version 4.

   Install Emacs version 27 or later.

   Install the Emacs packages Dash, lsp-mode and Magit-Section.  Dash is
the only one of these packages that is available in the default GNU Elpa
(https://elpa.gnu.org) package-archive.  You can install the remaining
packages either from source or from Melpa
(https://melpa.org/#/getting-started) package-archive.  For later
approach, add the following to your Emacs initialization file (e.g.
‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’):

     (require 'package)

     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))

     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'dash)
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'lsp-mode)
     (add-to-list 'package-selected-packages 'magit-section)

     (package-refresh-contents)
     (package-install-selected-packages 'no-confirm)

   Clone the Git repository of Lean4-Mode:

     git clone https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode.git ~/path/to/lean4-mode

   In your Emacs initialization file, add the path to your local
Lean4-Mode repository to the ‘load-path’ list:
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/lean4-mode")

   Lean4-Mode should now already be enabled when you open a file with
‘.lean’ extension.  But you can optionally also already load Lean4-Mode
on Emacs startup, e.g.  in order to customize variables:
     (require 'lean4-mode)

1.3 Instructions for Source-Based Use-Package
=============================================

If you use a source-based package-manager (e.g.  ‘package-vc.el’,
Straight or Elpaca), then make sure to list the ‘"data"’ directory in
your Lean4-Mode package recipe.

   If you use the ‘use-package’ macro and intent to defer loading of
packages in order to improve your Emacs startup time, then make sure to
specify ‘lean4-mode’ as a ‘:command’.

   Following subsections show concrete examples.

File: lean4-mode.info,  Node: Native vc (Emacs 30 or later),  Next: Doom-Emacs,  Up: Instructions for Source-Based Use-Package

1.3.1 Native ‘:vc’ (Emacs 30 or later)
--------------------------------------

GNU Emacs comes with ‘use-package.el’ built-in since version 29.  And
since version 30, it also comes with a built-in ‘:vc’ keyword for the
‘use-package’ macro that utilizes ‘package-vc.el’ to install Emacs
packages from remote source repositories.

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
     (package-initialize)

     (use-package lean4-mode
       :commands lean4-mode
       :vc (:url "https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-mode.git"
            :rev :last-release
            ;; Or, if you prefer the bleeding edge version of Lean4-Mode:
            ;; :rev :newest
            ))

1.3.2 Doom-Emacs
----------------

If you use Doom-Emacs, you can place the following code in your Doom
initialization file:

     (package! lean4-mode
       :recipe (:host github
                :repo "leanprover-community/lean4-mode"
                :files ("*.el" "data")))


File: lean4-mode.info,  Node: Straight,  Prev: Doom-Emacs,  Up: Instructions for Source-Based Use-Package

1.3.3 Straight
--------------

If you use the Straight package manager through Use-Package, then place
the following code in your Emacs initialization file:

     (use-package lean4-mode
       :commands lean4-mode
       :straight (lean4-mode :type git :host github
                             :repo "leanprover-community/lean4-mode"
                             :files ("*.el" "data")))

2 Usage
*******

If things are working correctly, you should see the word "Lean 4" in
Emacs mode-line when you open a file with ‘.lean’ extension.  Emacs will
ask you to identify the _project_ this file belongs to.  If you then
type ‘#check id’, the word ‘#check’ will be underlined, and hovering
over it will show you the type of ‘id’.

   To view the proof state, run ‘lean4-info-mode’ (‘C-c C-i’).  This
will display the ‘*Lean Goals*’ buffer (like the Lean Info-View pane in
VS-Code) in a separate window.

Key                      Description                                              Command
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘C-c C-k’                Echo the keystroke needed to input the symbol at point   ‘quail-show-key’
‘C-c C-d’                Recompile and reload imports                             ‘lean4-lsp-document-reopen’
‘C-c C-x’ or ‘C-c C-l’   Execute Lean in stand-alone mode                         ‘lean4-std-exe’
‘C-c C-p C-l’            Builds package with lake                                 ‘lean4-lake-build’
‘C-c C-i’                Toggle Info-View which shows goals and errors at point   ‘lean4-info-mode’

File: lean4-mode.info,  Node: lsp-mode,  Next: Flycheck,  Up: Usage

2.1 lsp-mode
============

For key bindings from lsp-mode, see its respective documentation
(https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/keybindings/) and note that
not all capabilities are supported by Lean4-Mode.


File: lean4-mode.info,  Node: Flycheck,  Prev: lsp-mode,  Up: Usage

2.2 Flycheck
============

You may optionally use Lean4-Mode together with Flycheck.  In that case,
the mode-line will show ‘FlyC:E/N’, indicating that there are ‘E’ number
of errors and ‘N’ number of notes.  Following keys will be available by
default (via ‘flycheck-mode-map’):

Key         Description            Command
---------------------------------------------------------------
‘C-c ! n’   Go to next error       ‘flycheck-next-error’
‘C-c ! p’   Go to previous error   ‘flycheck-previous-error’

3 Configuration
***************

* Menu:

* lsp-mode: lsp-mode (1).
* Flycheck: Flycheck (1).


File: lean4-mode.info,  Node: lsp-mode (1),  Next: Flycheck (1),  Up: Configuration

3.1 lsp-mode
============

If you want breadcrumbs of namespaces and sections to be shown in the
header-line, set the user option ‘lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable’ to
‘t’.


File: lean4-mode.info,  Node: Flycheck (1),  Prev: lsp-mode (1),  Up: Configuration

3.2 Flycheck
============

Flycheck is an optional but supported dependency of Lean4-Mode.  If
Flycheck is installed, lsp-mode and thus Lean4-Mode will by default use
it.  If you want to customize this behavior, e.g.  if you'd like to use
Emacs' built-in Flymake package instead of Flycheck while keeping later
installed, then customize the ‘lsp-diagnostics-provider’ user option
accordingly.


File: lean4-mode.info,  Node: Common Pitfalls,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Top

4 Common Pitfalls
*****************

Lean4-Mode only supports version 4 of Lean.  For editing Lean version 3,
use Lean3-Mode (https://github.com/leanprover/lean3-mode), which is also
known as Lean-Mode due to historical reasons.  In principle, it is fine
to have both Lean3-Mode and Lean4-Mode installed at the same time.  But
note that Lean3-Mode uses the prefix ‘lean-’ for its symbols.  E.g.  you
should not use ‘lean-’-prefixed commands in a buffer with Lean4-Mode as
major mode.
